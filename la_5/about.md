An experiment in fractal Brownian motion using [psrdnoise](https://github.com/stegu/psrdnoise), a noise algorithm heavily inspired by Simplex noise. The base noise function was octaved 3 times, ridgelined and raised to the fourth power, resulting in an ever-flowing milieu of strings flitting in and out of phase.
