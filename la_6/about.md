The aquarium now has a third dimension!

Particle positions (all 10000 of them), and positional offsets are defined by the JS program and passed as attributes to the vertex shader -> the vertex shader controls particle movement, calculates a parameter related to the distance of the particle from the origin and passes this to the fragment shader -> the fragment shader controls particle shape and color.
