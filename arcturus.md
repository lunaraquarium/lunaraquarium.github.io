title: Arcturus
---

If my current journey is crossing the Sahara, Arcturus was my journey to Tangier. Between 2020 and 2022, I experimented with [p5.js](https://p5js.org) as a means of visualizing certain physical and mathematical phenomena that I found interesting. This was also a particularly itinerant time in the larger story of my life, and my intial resolve to continue experimenting was quickly challenged by the multiple moves and adjustments to new environments during this era.  Six of these experiments can be seen [here.](https://duck-triad.github.io/arcturus/)
