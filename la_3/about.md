I was about to write a couple sentences expressing my love of the sine function, but I've changed my mind. 
Reason is, the [triangle wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_wave) is a tremendously underrated source of periodicity. 
Combining the sharp and inexpensive features of the triangle wave with the, um, "sine-ness" of the sine wave creates some interesting possibilities.
